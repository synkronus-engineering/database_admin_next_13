4,84be6cb8-bc8e-4fb3-8d10-cded5b90d855,Meta Enters The AI Race With An “Open” Approach,"<p>Onthe heels of a&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/threads-is-an-overnight-success-now-what-6d3e18987a9e"">successful launch of Threads</a>, Meta released another important product last week that has garnered much less attention by comparison, but one that could prove to have a huge impact on consumer technology down the road. The product in question? Llama 2, the newest version of Meta&rsquo;s large language model.</p>
<p>So far, the development of consumer-facing generative AI has been a two-horse race between Google and Microsoft, the latter of which benefited greatly from its early investments in and close partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, whose viral adoption kicked off this current round of AI frenzy.</p>
<p>With the arrival of Llama 2, the competitive landscape of generative AI might start to shift from primarily &ldquo;Microsoft vs. Google&rdquo; to a showdown between two different development models &mdash; Open Source vs. Closed. Up until now, the competition has been primarily between Microsoft and Google, both favoring a closed model. However, the open-source nature of Llama 2 could attract new players to the field and contribute to a more diverse and competitive market. This could accelerate the development of consumer-facing AI applications and ultimately benefit consumers.</p>
<h1><strong>What Makes Llama 2 Special</strong></h1>
<p>Llama stands for Large Language Model Meta AI. As its name suggests, it is a large language model (LLM) created by Meta; the first edition was officially released in February 2023 not as a public chatbot (a la ChatGPT), but as an open-source package that anyone in the AI community can request access to. A week after, however, the entire model&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was leaked online</a> and spread across various AI developer communities. But as a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; LLM model, Llama has not been &ldquo;fine-tuned&rdquo; for conversations like ChatGPT or Bing has, which means that average users wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it even if they downloaded a leak. Nevertheless, the leak sparked some questions about Meta&rsquo;s role in the generative AI space.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week, on July 18,&nbsp;<a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meta announced Llama 2</a> in partnership with Microsoft. According to Meta, Llama 2 was trained on 40 percent more data when compared to Llama 1, which includes information from &ldquo;publicly available online data sources.&rdquo; AI researchers have found that when compared to GPT-4, the latest LLM by OpenAI, Llama 2&nbsp;<a href=""https://analyticsindiamag.com/llama-2-vs-gpt-4-vs-claude-2/"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">excels at writing texts</a> and is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cloudbooklet.com/llama-2-vs-gpt-4/#conclusion"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more user-friendly</a>, whereas GPT-4 is more adaptable and can handle more difficult tasks such as coding. Half of ChatGPT 3.5&rsquo;s size, this new model is&nbsp;<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/llama-2-llm"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">portable to smartphones</a> and, unlike LLaMa 1, fully fine-tuned for conversations.</p>
<p>More importantly, Llama 2 is being released on an &ldquo;open source&rdquo; model, meaning that it&rsquo;s free for all research and commercial use &mdash; as long as any AI applications built upon it <a href=""https://fortune.com/2023/07/18/meta-llama-2-ai-open-source-700-million-mau/"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">do not exceed 700 million monthly active users</a>, (a clear guardrail preventing other big tech companies from using it for free.) Given this limitation in the fine print of its licensing agreement, Llama 2 is <a href=""https://blog.opensource.org/metas-llama-2-license-is-not-open-source/"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">technically not &rdquo;open source&rdquo;</a> in the purest sense of that term, but for the vast majority of developers tapping into this LLM courtesy of Meta, it is a free-to-use resource by all practical intent and purposes.</p>
<p>While Llama is far from the only open source LLM available &mdash; <a href=""https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/list-of-open-source-large-language-models-llms-4eac551bda2e"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">check here</a> for a full list &mdash; it might very well be the most useful for AI developers. Developing an LLM can be an expensive endeavor, especially for AI training and fine-tuning with human feedback. The wide availability of Llama 2 could spur a lot more experimentation, without developers needing to pay OpenAI or Google for access to their respective LLM, thus undermining a key part of the current business models for the market leaders in the generative AI space. Of course, it&rsquo;d still cost a pretty penny to buy a slew of GPUs required to run Llama-based AI applications at scale, but that&rsquo;s nothing compared to the licensing fees that&nbsp;<a href=""https://openai.com/pricing"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OpenAI is charging</a> for access to its GPT-4 model.<br><br><br></p>
<h1><strong>What This Mean for the AI Competitive Landscape</strong></h1>
<p>The launch of Llama 2 is a significant event in the competitive landscape of generative AI. As the first major open-source LLM developed by a &ldquo;big tech&rdquo; firm, it could have a major impact on the way that generative AI models are developed and deployed.</p>
<p>Up until now, the generative AI market has been dominated by closed-source models from companies like OpenAI and Google. While these models can be quite powerful, they are also very expensive to develop and maintain, which has made it difficult for smaller companies and independent developers to get involved in the field.</p>
<p>In theory, Llama 2 alters this equation. It is a powerful LLM that is available to anyone to use, which means that smaller companies and independent developers can now compete with the big players in the field.</p>",,"[""73738f4d-4a59-4c91-8c1e-bcabf177eb9a""]",2023-07-29 15:25:10.375328+00,blog-44.jpeg,AI,What Is Llama 2 and what does it mean for the competitive landscape of generative AI.,"{""authnameor"":""Mark Zuckerberg"",""srcImg"":""avatar-f-1.png""}"

                                <p>Flow is a psychological and physiological state of peak performance.</p>
                                <p>It&rsquo;s where we feel our best and perform at our best &mdash; both mentally and physically.</p>
                                <p>A 10-year <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/increasing-the-meaning-quotient-of-work"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey study</a> on flow and productivity found that top executives report a <strong>400% increase in performance</strong> during flow.</p>
                                <p>In other words, if you work for two hours per day in a flow state, you&rsquo;ll get as much done as most people do in an average 8-hour workday.</p>
                                <h1>Flow Is A State of Mental Peak Performance</h1>
                                <p>Steven Kotler, an expert on flow states and author of The Art of Impossible, writes that during flow:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Mental and physical ability go through the roof, and the brain takes in more information per second, processing it more deeply.&rdquo;</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>Recent <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5855042/"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank"">neuroscience</a> shows that during flow, our brainwave activity measurably changes we experience a powerful shift in neurochemistry.</p>
                                <p>When in flow, a combination of norepinephrine, dopamine, endorphins, anandamide, serotonin, and &mdash; sometimes &mdash; oxytocin floods the system.</p>
                                <p>This creates a potent <strong>neurochemical cocktail for peak performance</strong> and makes flow one of the most enjoyable and rewarding human states.</p>
                                <p>As Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of Flow and known as &lsquo;the father of flow, wrote:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p><em>&ldquo;The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times&hellip; The best moments usually occur if a person&rsquo;s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.&rdquo;</em></p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>But getting into a flow state (especially in today&rsquo;s distraction-overload world) can feel like a mystery to many of us.</p>

In an ideal world, DevOps is more than just a fancy term; it represents a cultural shift where developers and operations collaborate seamlessly. However, in many enterprises I&rsquo;ve observed, they&rsquo;re doing it wrong. They create separate &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; squads or teams to manage Kubernetes clusters, centralized CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and automation. The outcome? Developers find themselves working in a ready-to-use yet restrictive environment, far from the promised autonomy of the microservices approach.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>Many developers continue to use the useState and useEffect hooks to update states, but I have not been fond of this approach. The issue is that it causes the component to mount, remount, and unmount simultaneously, leading to unexpected behavior. As a result, when logging something into the console, you may see the result repeated three times.</p>
                                <h1>Introducing the useLoaderData Hook:</h1>
                                <p>The <code>useLoaderData</code> hook is a custom hook in React that helps you load data into your component. It simplifies the process of fetching data from an API or performing any asynchronous operation.</p>
                                <p><mark>When you use the&nbsp;</mark><mark><code>useLoaderData</code></mark><mark>&nbsp;hook, you provide it with a function that returns a Promise. This Promise represents an asynchronous operation that will fetch the data you need. Once the Promise resolves, the data becomes available to your component.</mark></p>
                                <p>The <code>useLoaderData</code> hook handles the loading state for you, so you don&apos;t need to manually track whether the data is still loading or if it has finished loading. It provides you with a convenient way to access the data and also handles any potential errors that might occur during the data loading process.</p>
                                <p>By using the <code>useLoaderData</code> hook, you can keep your component code clean and organized, separating the data-loading logic from the rest of your component&apos;s responsibilities. It allows you to easily fetch and manage data in a more beginner-friendly way.</p>
                                <h1>Why the useLoaderHook?</h1>
                                <p>The useLoaderHook from react-router helps achieve the same functionality with minimal effort. These are some examples of why you should use it.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Loading state management</strong>: Loaders handle the loading state for you, providing a clear indication of when data is being fetched. This helps you manage loading spinners, progress indicators, or any other UI elements related to data loading.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Error handling</strong>: Loaders often include error handling mechanisms, allowing you to handle and display errors that occur during the data loading process. They provide a standardized way to handle errors, making it easier to implement consistent error handling across your application.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong>: Loaders allow you to separate the data loading logic from other aspects of your component. This promotes better code organization and maintainability, as you can focus on specific responsibilities without mixing them.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>And lots more.</p>

<h1>Exploring the Loader functions:</h1>
<p>As we now have a bit of an understanding of how we can set up our application to use the Loader API, let&rsquo;s see how we can use the API.</p>
<p>Say you intend to fetch data from an endpoint andto be displayed on the&nbsp;<code>homeComponent</code>. What most developers would do is: initialize a state and update the state in the&nbsp;<strong>useEffect&nbsp;</strong>hook. The snippet below provides a clear illustration of what I am talking about.</p>
<pre>import { useState } from &apos;react&apos;

const HomeComponent = () =&gt; {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    
    useEffect(async () =&gt; {
        const request = await fetch(&apos;http://localhost:3004/file&apos;);
         if(!request.ok) throw new Error(&apos;Failed to fetch data&apos;)
        const item= await request.json()
        setData(item)  
    }, [])

    return (
        &lt;section&gt;
            { data.length &gt; 0 ? data.map((foundData) =&gt; (
                    &lt;div key={foundData.id}&gt;
                        &lt;strong&gt;{foundData.name}&lt;/strong&gt;
                     &lt;/div&gt;
                 )) : &lt;p&gt;Data currently unavailable&lt;/p&gt;}
        &lt;/section&gt;
    )
}
export default HomeComponent</pre>
<p>This is a tonne of lines as we might want to simplify this a bit and maybe reuse the same function.</p>
<p>To use&nbsp;<strong>Loaders</strong>, you have to define a&nbsp;<strong>loader&nbsp;</strong>function. Loader functions are like&nbsp;<strong>Custom Hooks</strong>.<br>Besides, the naming convention of the function doesn&rsquo;t matter as you can call it anything. In the code snippet below, I will create a basic loader function that fetches data from an API like I showed in the snipppet above</p>
<pre>export async function LoaderFunction () {
    const request = await fetch(&apos;http://localhost:3004/file&apos;);
    if (!request.ok) throw new Error (&apos;Failed to fetch item&apos;)
    const item = await  response.json();
    return item;
};</pre>
<p>Now, we have to import the loader function to component where our routes are being handled. After setting up your route system using the&nbsp;<code>createBrowserRouter</code> and&nbsp;<code>createRouteFromElements</code> you should have access to a prop called&nbsp;<code>loader</code>. There you should pass in the&nbsp;<code>LoaderFunction</code> you created as the value.<br>In the code snippet below provides a clear illustration of this.</p>
<pre>import { 
createBrowserRouter,
createRoutesFromElements,
RouterProvider,
Route, 
Outlet
 } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;
import HomeComponent from &quot;./home&quot;
import AboutComponent from &quot;./about&quot;
import { LoaderFunction as HomeLoader} from &quot;./loader&quot;

function App() {
    const browserRoutes = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElements(
       &lt;Route path=&apos;/&apos; element={&lt;Outlet /&gt;}&gt;
                &lt;Route index element={&lt;HomeComponent /&gt; }
                     loader={HomeLoader}/&gt;
                &lt;Route path=&apos;about&apos; element={&lt;AboutComponent /&gt; } /&gt;
        &lt;/Route&gt;
    ))

     return (
        &lt;RouterProvider router={browserRoutes} /&gt;
    );
}</pre>
<p>After that, We can access the data returned by the loader function using the&nbsp;<strong>useLoaderData&nbsp;</strong>Hook from react-router in the HomeComponent.<br>The code snippet below best explains what just read.</p>
<pre>import { useLoaderData } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;

const HomeComponent = () =&gt; {
    const data = useLoaderData();

    return (
        &lt;section&gt;
            {data.map((foundData) =&gt; (
                    &lt;div key={foundData.id}&gt;
                         &lt;strong&gt;{foundData.name}&lt;/strong&gt; 
                    &lt;/div&gt; 
            ))}
        &lt;/section&gt;
    )
}
export default HomeComponent</pre>
<p><strong>Wow! 😲..</strong><br>Now see how we have just cleaned up the HomeComponent :)<br>Noticed we got rid of the guard clause that checks if the data is null.<br>This is because react-router makes it load the data as soon as the url/path is active. So, it Makes the necessary requests even before the&nbsp;<strong>Component is Mounted</strong>. Yes!</p>
<p>We are only making provisions for the happy path. What if we pass a non-existing endpoint? If that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t panic as react-router also allow us to pass components to another prop called&nbsp;<code>errorElement</code> .<br>This is specifically for Errors just as we use&nbsp;<code>ErrorBoundaries</code>. Let&apos;s see how this works in the snippet below</p>","[""2c58a5f0-9365-4cd8-ba82-355ad6168089""]","[""73738f4d-4a59-4c91-8c1e-bcabf177eb9a""]",2023-07-29 15:30:47.358381+00,blog-66.jpeg,React,"Many developers continue to use the useState and useEffect hooks to update states, but I have not been fond of this approach.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Writing test cases.</em> Most of the time I write the name for the test case and Copilot fills out everything else.</li>
                                    <li><em>Small things I would have to look up.</em> e.g. Instead of searching for the correct RegEx to parse a string, I write a comment explaining what I want the RegEx to do and Copilot writes the RegEx for me.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h1>2. Kagi: a better search engine than Google</h1>
                                <p>I measure the effectiveness of searches by how long it takes me to find what I was actually looking for. By that measure, Google has been steadily getting worse.</p>
                                <p>When I search for something on Kagi, the correct result is in the first 2 links 95% of the time. It&rsquo;s in the top 5 links 99% of the time. That just doesn&rsquo;t happen with Google, Bing, etc.</p>
                                <p>The consistently great results page is further boosted by the search personalization I control. I&rsquo;ve told Kagi that any results from Stack Overflow or Medium should be weighted higher, as well as blocked other sites I don&rsquo;t care to see results from.</p>
